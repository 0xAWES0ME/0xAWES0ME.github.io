This is a writeup of the challenge rarara from the secuinside 2014 pre-qual ctf.

This was the probably the hardest challenge in the competition and only one team had managed to solve it a few hours before the competition ended when my team had to leave early.

We had figured out the solution but ran out of time before implementing it. Had we stayed and finished this level and another we likely would have been in the top ten teams, but oh well!
